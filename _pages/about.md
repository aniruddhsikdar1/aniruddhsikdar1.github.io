I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab (AIRL), RBCCPS, IISc, Bangalore, grateful to work under the supervision of Prof. Suresh Sundaram. My research focuses on computer vision for robotics applications, particularly in multi-sensor fusion, generalization to unseen target domains, and continual learning. I also had the opportunity to work with Prof. Sundarrajan during the earlier part of my Ph.D.


My research focuses on addressing real-world computer vision challenges in ground, aerial, and underwater robotic domains, with an emphasis on multi-sensor fusion, generalization to unseen domains, and continual learning. At the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab (AIRL), IISc, I have contributed to several real-world projects and collaborated with startups from the Society of Innovation and Development (SID) and Artpark. I have evaluated state-of-the-art deep learning models for segmentation, detection, and change detection across platforms such as ground vehicles, drones, and satellites, using sensors like RGB, Infrared (IR), and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). My work includes sim-to-real evaluations and the use of generative AI techniques to improve generalization, reinforcing my commitment to practical, real-world solutions.



 
I am motivated to publish in top-tier conferences, with publications in CVPR, AAAI, ICRA, IROS, and ICASSP, including several oral presentations. I also received the Outstanding Reviewer Award at CVPR 2026.
